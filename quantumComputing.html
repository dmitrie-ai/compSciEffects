                <p>Here are some mind bending facts about Quantum Computing that you might find interesting:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Quantum computing requires extremely cold temperatures, as sub-atomic particles must be as close as possible to a stationary state to be measured. The cores of D-Wave quantum computers operate at -460 degrees f, or -273 degrees c, which is 0.02 degrees away from absolute zero</li>
                        <li>Quantum computing is often described as “natural”. This is because although we don’t completely understand them, the mechanisms underpinning the real world (which have evolved through nature) clearly operate at a sub-atomic level. By simulating this with computers, we come a huge step closer to being able to simulate the natural world</li>
                        <li>At a quantum level, science fiction appears to become reality. Particles can travel backward or forwards in time and teleport (quantum tunneling) between two positions</li>
                        <li>One possible explanation for why quantum computers work involves parallel universes. It has been theorized that qubits are able to exist in two states simultaneously because we are observing them in multiple universes simultaneously</li>
                    </ul>
                <img  src = "C:\Users\perry\GitPages\QuantumCompPic3.JPG" alt ="My test image" width = 500 height = 300>
                <p>Quantum Mechanincs(how it really works):</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Quantum computing aims to take advantage of unusual properties that matter exhibits once we begin to study it at a level of detail below atomic level – the sub-atomic, or quantum level.</li>
                        <li>While conventional computer use binary “bits” (one and zero) as the process for calculation, a quantum computer uses <a href="https://computer.howstuffworks.com/quantum-computer1.htm">quantum bits</a>, knows as qubits – which can exist in both states simultaneously, as well as many other states in between.</li>
                        <li>Qubits exhibit properties of <a href="https://securityintelligence.com/applying-the-principles-of-quantum-entanglement-to-secure-communication/">quantum entanglement</a> – a phenomenon that means pairs, or groups, of particles, cannot be measured or described independently of each other – they are “entangled” and their state depends on that of other particles in the group.</li>
                        <li>Due to factors which are still not fully understood despite the best efforts of Einstein, Shrodinger and many others since, it appears that particles linked in this way can transfer information between each other, even though, theoretically, they could be an unlimited distance apart.</li>
                        <li>Computer scientists working on quantum computers believe that in the future it will be possible to harness these mechanisms and build computers which will be millions of times more efficient that anything available today.</li>
                    </ul>
                <img  src = "C:\Users\perry\GitPages\QuantumCompPic2.JPG" alt ="My test image" width = 400 height = 300>
                <p>Meanwhile how has Quantum computing been used in the real world....</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The possibility of quantum computing was first proposed by physicist <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Feynman">Richar Feynman</a> in 1982</li>
                        <li>In 1994, mathematician Peter Shaw demonstrated how quantum computing could be used to crack the common encryption standards available then – many of which are still in use today</li>
                        <li>DARPA brought online the world’s first operational <a href = "https://www.picoquant.com/applications/category/quantum-optics/quantum-communication">quantum network</a> in 2003, breaking new ground in the fields of quantum computing as well as secure communications</li>
                        <li>The world’s first dedicated quantum computing focused commercial business – <a href="https://1qbit.com/">1Qbit</a> – was established in Vancouver, British Columbia, in 2012</li>
                        <li>IBM launched Q, which offers 5 qubit quantum computing services via cloud in 2016. Last year it upgraded to 20 qubits of quantum processing power</li>
                        <li>Organizations which are publicly known to be making use of D-Wave’s quantum computing infrastructure include Google, NASA and Lockheed Martin</li>
                    </ul>
                <img  src = "C:\Users\perry\GitPages\QuantumCompPic4.JPG" alt ="My test image" width = 500 height = 300>
                <p>Benefits of Quantum Computing</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Online security</li>
                        <p>There will be good and bad for online security once there is widespread adoption of quantum computers. The bad? Our current data encryption tactics will become obsolete. Currently, most online security methods count on the fact that it takes an extraordinary amount of time to “crack the code” as computers crunch large numbers. However, quantum computers will be able to process this information quickly leaving our computers, financial institutions and private information vulnerable. The good news is that significant work has been done to develop <a href = "https://singularityhub.com/2016/11/24/quantum-computers-could-crush-todays-top-encryption-in-15-years/">quantum encryption methods</a> such as quantum key distribution, an ultra-secure communication method that requires a key to decipher a message. Thanks to the peculiar properties of quantum mechanics, if the message gets intercepted, no one else can read it.</p>
                        <li>Artificial intelligence</li>
                        <p>The information processing that it critical to <a href = "https://www.bernardmarr.com/default.asp?contentID=958">improve machine learning</a> is ideally suited to quantum computing. Quantum computers can analyze large quantities of data to provide artificial intelligence machines the feedback required to improve performance. Quantum computers are able to analyze the data to provide feedback much more efficiently than traditional computers and therefore the learning curve for artificial intelligence machines is shortened. Just like humans, artificial intelligence machines powered by the insights from quantum computers can learn from experience and self-correct. Quantum computers will help artificial intelligence expand to more industries and help technology become much more intuitive very quickly.</p>
                        <li>Drug development</li>
                        <p>In order to develop an effective drug, chemists need to evaluate the interactions between molecules, proteins and chemicals to see if medicines will improve certain conditions or cure diseases. Due to the extraordinary amount of combinations that are analyzed, this is time and labor intensive. Since quantum computers can review multiple molecules, proteins and chemicals simultaneously, they make it possible for chemists to determine viable drug options quicker. Additionally, some drugs are being cancelled in the trial stage even when they might work for a subset of the population. Quantum computing would allow for a person’s genes to be sequenced and analyzed much more rapidly than the methods we use today and would allow for personalized drug development.</p>
                        <li>Improve weather forecasting and climate change predictions</li>
                        <p>Even with sophisticated tools, weather forecasting remains a bit of a guessing game. Just ask anyone who has been caught in a storm with no warning or prepared for a blizzard but ultimately only saw flurries. Since quantum computers can analyze all the data at once, meteorologists will have a much better idea of when bad weather will strike to alert people to ultimately save lives, anguish and money. The <a href = "https://www.nextplatform.com/2016/06/28/novel-architectures-far-horizon-weather-prediction/">UK Met Office</a>, the national weather service of the United Kingdom, has already invested in quantum computing technology to help improve forecasting. We can also gain more insight into how we are influencing our climate because quantum computers will help us build better climate models. The sooner we know how things are expected to shift, the better we will be able to prepare and respond to climate change and its impact.</p>
                        <li>Traffic control</li>
                        <p>Whether in the air or on the ground, quantum computers will help to streamline traffic control. They will be able to quickly calculate the optimal routes concurrently which allows for efficient scheduling and would reduce traffic congestion. For similar reasons, quantum computers are also powerful for optimizing supply chains, air traffic control, fleet operations and deliveries</p>
                        <li>Tackling the whole problem</li>
                        <p>Instead of troubleshooting issues bit by bit as we do now with classical computers, quantum computers tackle the entire problem at once. This opens the door for amazing developments in every field from financial services to our national security</p>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Perhaps Eric Ladizinsky, co-founder of quantum computing company D-Wave, explained the differences between a regular computer and a quantum computer best when he spoke at WIRED 2014 conference. He said to imagine that you only have five minutes to find an X written on a page of a book among the 50 million books in the Library of Congress. In this scenario, you would be a regular computer and you would never find the X. But, if you had 50 million parallel realities and you could look at a different book in each of those realities (just like a quantum computer), you would find the X. A quantum computer splits you into 50 million versions of yourself to make the work quick and easy.</p>
                    <p>Quantum computers give us the ability to solve complex problems that are beyond the capabilities of classical computers.</p>
                    <p>We’re heading down an entirely new field of physics, and by its very nature there will be discoveries, innovations and solutions we have never dreamed of yet.</p>
